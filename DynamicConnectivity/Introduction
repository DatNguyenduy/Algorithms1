The goal is to write a program to filter out extraneous pair (pairs where both objects are in the same equivalence class) from the sequence.
In other words, when the program reads a pair q p from the input, it should write the pair to the outout only if the pairs it has seen to that
point do not imply that p is connected to q. If the previous paird do imply that p is connected to q, then the program should ignore the pair
p q and proceed to read in the next pair.
This problem arises applications such as the following:
Networks.
Variable-name equivalence.
Mathematical sets.
